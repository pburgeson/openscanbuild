# openscanbuild
Build and testing of 3D scanner from Open Scan (https://en.openscan.eu/).  This is just using their plans and documents to successfully build a 3d scanner that uses photogrammetry.  My primary intent is to not have to measure objects that I want to design around in CAD.  Typically that means I'll be 3D printing the parts that make with it so precision is not incredibly critcal.  If I can get with +/- 0.010 in, I'll be pretty happy. 

A secondary goal is to develop processes and methods for updating github with project info and something akin to a project log.

# High Level Requirements
1. Able to generate 3D data that Autodesk Fusion 360 is capable of working with.
2. Precision of 0.010" or better
3. Scan Volume - Cylinder of radius ?? in and height ?? in
4. Use of trinamic stepper drivers

Future projects will include substantially more requirements development.  Since this project is about building a thing that someone else's design and documenting it, we won't go into a lot more detail.
